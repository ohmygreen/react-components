# Garten brand colors

For our internal tools, we will use Garten brand colors sparingly as they don’t quite lend
themselves to a comprehensive and accessible palette.

# Core UI colors

## Greys

Greys make up the core UI elements of our products, like page backgrounds, borders, etc.
This palette is made up of “cool” greys that are created using the same hue as the dark teal Garten brand color.

- To maintain “cool” hues across the UI, **we will use Grey 900 instead of pure black whenever transparency values are needed.**
  - Ex. Primary text: Grey 900 @ 90%
  - Ex. Hover state: Grey 900 @ 5%

grey-900: #0a0c0d  
grey-800: #2b2c2d  
grey-700: #484a4b  
grey-600: #646869  
grey-500: #818587  
grey-400: #9ea3a5  
grey-300: #bcc1c3  
grey-200: #dadfe1  
grey-100: #e9eef0  
grey-50: #f5f9fa

## Other colors

The extended palette contains the full spectrum of the semantic colors. These should be used very sparingly, and ideally, we would only use a couple from each set.

## Semantic colors

#### Positive

This includes success states, positive/good numerical values, etc

- color-positive: green-800;
- color-positive-bg: green-50;

#### Negative

This includes error states, negative/bad numerical values, etc.

- color-negative: red-800;
- color-negative-bg: red-50;

#### Warning

This includes warnings/alerts that aren’t necessarily errors
These values should only be used on a dark background or as a background with dark text

- color-warning: yellow-800;

#### Info

This includes links and other informative UI elements

- color-info: blue-800;
- color-info-bg: blue-50;

You should pay close attention to the application of these colors to maintain accessibility standards. Refer to the image below to understand how you can use each color…

- Normal text (smaller Aa) refers to text size 24px or less and should have a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 or higher
  Large text (bigger Aa) refers to text larger than 24px OR 18px and above when bolded
- The star represents UI elements, like icons
- Large text and UI elements should have a contrast ratio of 3:1 or higher

# Text & icon colors

Our text colors will be created using white and Grey-900, along with opacity values to create secondary and disabled styles.

## Dark

- text-dark-primary: grey-900; @ 90% opacity
- text-dark-secondary: grey-900; @ 65% opacity
- text-dark-disabled: blue-50; @ 40% opacity

The disabled grey is not accessible, however, According to WCAG 2.0, inactive elements do not need to meet contrast standards. With that said, we should use this value sparingly.

## Light

- text-light-primary: white; @ 100% opacity
- text-light-secondary: white; @ 65% opacity
- text-light-disabled: white; @ 40% opacity

_It is usually recommended to avoid pure white on pure black, but since we are using a dark grey instead of pure black, we can use white @ 100% opacity instead of 90% as we did with the dark colors_
